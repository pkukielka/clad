{"body":"## About\r\nThe goal of Clad is to provide platform independent, persistent service which provides API very similar to libclang C API, but can be accessed easily from any programming language without need to write C bindings.  \r\nThis should significantly simplify process of building stateless commandline utilities based on Clang (state is moved to service instead, you don't need to reparse all files every time you run your tool) as well as testing Clang using other languages, even exotic ones.  \r\n  \r\n## Building the server\r\nTo build Clad you need to have:\r\n- Clang 3.2\r\n- CMake 2.6\r\n- Thrift 0.9\r\n- GTest 1.6\r\n  \r\nYou don't need to have full Clang installation but CMake must be able to find libclang 3.2 headers and library.\r\nIf you will try to use other Clang version there is high chance that it wont compile or will break on runtime.  \r\nYour Thrift and GTest versions can be different, but I cannot guarantee that it will work then.  \r\nBuilding Clad is pretty straightforward:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/$ git clone https://github.com/pkukielka/clad.git  \r\n~/$ cd clad && mkdir build && cd build  \r\n~/clad/build$ cmake ..  \r\n~/clad/build$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also run tests to ensure that everything works as intended:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/clad/build$ make test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Client API\r\nClients APIs are not part of the Clad distribution because of two reasons:\r\n- there is ~14 languages supported, a it too many to manage them easily (you can find full list inside Thrift documentation: http://thrift.apache.org/docs/features/)\r\n- it's very easy to generate all the files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/clad/build$ thrift -r --gen java ../thrift/Clang.thrift\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate full API for java. To see list of all available generators open terminal and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthrift -help\r\n```","note":"Don't delete this file!
